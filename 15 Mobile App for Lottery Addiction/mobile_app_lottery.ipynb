    "# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is part of a guided project available on [Dataquest.io](https://dataquest.io). In this project scenario we work for a medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities. The version of this app is focusing on [6/49 Lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) one of the three natinal lotteries in Canada. The functions in the app will enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
